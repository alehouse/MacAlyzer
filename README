 MacAlyzer -:- Mac OS X packet analyzer
========================================


 Project Description
---------------------

The goal of the project is to bring the same level of sophistication as
tcpdump and wireshark to the Mac in a graphical user interface that blends in
with the rest of the OS X utilities and capitalizes on the breadth of Apple APIs
available on the Mac platform, such as Grand Central Dispatch and CoreAnimation.


 Requirements
--------------
 * Mac OS X >= 10.6


 Getting Started
-----------------

The MacAlzyer releases are meant to be as straightforward as possible. Simply
extracting the application to the Applications folder should be sufficient for
installation.

For anyone building the sources, they are, hopefully, easily navigated. I did
include the Xcode project file(s) (the project was created using Xcode 4.0, so
there may be some compatibility issues with older version of Xcode) so that I
wouldn't have to explain the build process.


 Licensing
-----------

Nearly all, if not all, source is licensed under a 3-clause BSD license to
encourage sharing and freedom of source.
